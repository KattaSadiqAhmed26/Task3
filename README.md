****# Task3****  
In this task I had created a dataset and I started analysizing the data set using SQL where I performed cleaning First and after that I remove Null and duplicates  
where I can get accurate values.  
Firstly I used some sort of Bussiness question and answersing them Clearly by writing SQL code and getting insight from that.  
After that I create view for every Question so that every one can easily accessable it.  
I also used many type of commands like **SELECT** and **WHERE** Statements and I also Used **GROUPBY** and **ORDERBY** commands. 
I also used **Aggregate Functions** like **SUM,AVG,...**.  
 # ****Finally I created all meaningful Insights and Bussniess Insight which can help us to clearly Understand the Bussiness and can do better Practises accordingly.****
